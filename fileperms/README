This is just a simple proof of concept module.

It allows you to ensure that the permissions of a file meet permission restrictions.
It will flag files which contain permission bits that are more permissive than the
mode you specify.

Example:
  fileperms { 'sudoers':
    ensure => present,
    path   => '/etc/sudoers',
    perms  => '0640',
  }
